# OutreachHopper
Laser cutting designs for 2D hourglass/hopper. For use in outreach events

Hopper designs in two sizes. Large measures  ~25 x 30 cm, where small measures 20x30 cm. The box files should be cut out of clear 3 mm acrylic, the boundary files can be cut out of any thickness acrylic of any colour.

Each boundary file contains a U shaped bottom piece, 2 boundary edges all to be glued one of the box files around the edges. It also contains a top T to remove and change particles. There are two rectangular hopper arms to open and close the chambers. The top and arms should not be glued to the clear acrylic, however care should be taken when gluing the bottom and boundary edges to ensure that there is enough space for the arms to slide. 

To close the chamber, other piece of clear acrylic can be glued to the boundaries or can be clamped together using large binder clips.
